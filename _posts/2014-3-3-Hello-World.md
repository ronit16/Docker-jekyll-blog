title: Setting Up a Multi-Container Application with Docker
---

## Introduction
Docker has become an essential tool in modern software development, allowing developers to package applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to set up a multi-container application using Docker, which is particularly useful for projects with multiple components like frontend, backend, and databases.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts
- Knowledge of your application's frontend and backend technologies

## Part 1: Docker Setup
### Step 1: Installing Docker
To install Docker, follow these steps:
1. Visit the Docker website and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installation is complete, verify that Docker is installed by running `docker --version` in your terminal.

### Step 2: Docker Basics
Before diving into multi-container applications, it's important to understand some basic Docker concepts:
- **Containers**: Lightweight, portable environments that encapsulate an application and its dependencies.
- **Images**: Templates used to create containers. Images are created from Dockerfiles, which contain instructions for building the environment.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains all the commands needed to assemble a Docker image.

## Part 2: Creating Docker Images
### Step 3: Frontend Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile for the frontend application (assuming it's built with React). Here's an example:
```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the remaining frontend source code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
